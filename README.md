# Tree Isomorphism Checker

This is a JavaScript program to determine whether two rooted trees are isomorphic (structurally identical). It processes input from a file (`input1.txt`) and outputs the result as either **YES** or **NO**.

## Problem Overview

Two rooted trees are considered **isomorphic** if a one-to-one correspondence exists between their nodes, preserving the parent-child relationships.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `n` â€” the number of nodes in each tree.
- The next `n-1` lines describe the edges of the **first tree** in the form `parent child`.
- The subsequent `n-1` lines describe the edges of the **second tree** in the same format.

### Output Format

- The program outputs `YES` if the trees are isomorphic.
- Otherwise, it outputs `NO`.
